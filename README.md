MED4 OOP mini project game! Small 2D game made in Unity for a Medialogy 4th semester mini project in the Object Oriented Software Engineering course. 
Hand-in deadline: August 30th 2014, 03:00 PM.


-- Opening the game --
The game can be opened either by opening the "web build.html" file in the web build folder (correct aspect ratio, refresh page to try game again), or by using the "JumpJumpThaGame.exe" file in the main folder (wrong aspect ratio, press Alt + F4 to exit game).


-- Main Folder content --
JumpJumpThaGame_Data: Files for running the .exe file in the main folder.
jumping: Unity project folder, contains game assets, library files and project settings folders.
web build: Contains files for opening the game as a .html file

.gitattributes: Honestly, not sure what this does exactly, was made with the repository.
.gitignore: Ignore file, had some issues with it so Library and Project settings files were committed anyway.
JumpJumpThaGame.exe: .exe file for running the game in it's own window. Press Alt + F4 to exit.
README.md: This file. :)
